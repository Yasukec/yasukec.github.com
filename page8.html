    <h1>The Bill is Referred to the Senate</h1>
<p>When a bill passes in the House, it must also pass in the Senate in order to become a law. The two houses of Congress make up the bicameral legislature, part of a system of checks and balances that ensures that laws are created democratically.
    Members may choose to ignore the bill and continue to work on their own legislation.
    Members may vote to pass or not to pass the bill.</p>
