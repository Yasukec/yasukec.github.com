    <h1>The Bill is Considered on the House Floor</h1>
<p>A bill can come to the House Floor for consideration in a variety of ways. Many House bills are debated through a parliamentary device known as the Committee of the Whole, which is a mechanism that permits faster consideration.
    Floor action begins and Members debate the bill.
    The conduct of debate is dictated by the Rules of the House generally, and may also be governed by a special rule granted specifically for the bill under consideration.
    Next, the House is ready to vote on the bill.
    Current Floor Proceedings including major actions on bills are posted for public view on the website of the Clerk of the House.</p>
