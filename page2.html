    <h1>Introduction of a Bill</h1>
<p>Bills can be introduced whenever the House is in session.
In the House, bills are officially introduced by placing them in a special box known as the hopper, which is located at the rostrum, or Speaker's platform. In the Senate, a bill is introduced by placing it on the presiding officer's desk or by formally introducing it on the Senate Floor.

The first reading of a bill means the bill's title is read on the House Floor. The bill is then referred to a committee for markup.
The Library of Congress then receives an electronic copy of the bill and posts the bill and its status on Congress Bill Search, a public website.</p>
